# _Dance Monkey_ Beta-Testing Questionnaire (Before)

Thank you so much for beta-testing _Dance Monkey (DM)_! The name is based off of
the idea of a "code monkey" (someone who just follows instructions and codes).
My goal is that DM will help dancers to follow any dance they find on YouTube
without having to think about whether it's mirrored, looping over difficult
moves, etc.

Feel free to send me any feedback you have over discord (I'm `.__tarantula__.`)
or save them for the beta-testing questionnaire I'll send at the end of the week
to compare before/after results.

## Do you use DuckDuckGo as your search engine? If so, do you watch videos on DDG or on YouTube?

I haven't developed _DM_ for DDG because of some technical issues (DDG shows
videos in nested frames, which makes it kinda hard to find them in the
Document-Object Model). But I ask to know if it'd be useful to improve _DM_ so
that it works in DDG!

-   On YouTube

## How often do you dance each week (just estimate, eg. 3 times/week)?

## How long does it take you to learn a dance (to a level you'd be satisfied with)?

## How difficult is it to learn a dance from a video online?

From 1 to 5, with 1 being "pretty difficult" and 5 being "not that difficult".

## How often do you feel the urge to learn a dance?

## How often do you follow through on that urge (like X% of the time)?

# What to expect next

I'll send out this same survey in a week to see if using _DM_ helped with the
amount of time you spent dancing & if it helped you with learning dances online.
Hopefully it helps, but if it doesn't, that's fine. It was a fun project
anyways; at this point I just want to see if I could improve it for others to
benefit from it too.

Thanks again for your interest and help in _DM_! :)
