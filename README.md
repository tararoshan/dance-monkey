# Dance Monkey
a chrome/firefox extension to help with learning dances from YouTube videos. The
name comes from "code monkey" but for dancing (dance monkeys just follow what the
dancer on the screen does, code monkeys just code what their boss tells them to
code).

The Figma design file: [link](https://www.figma.com/file/tIFpsQBEdYRqMR03bvkYrz/dance-monkey?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=WpDWxXPhiKGkoPqq-1)

## Manual Testing in Firefox
Clone the repository, open Firefox > Add-ons Manager > Extensions >
gear/settings button > **Debug Add-ons** > Load Temporary Add-on... > select the
manifest.json file of Dance Monkey. Click "Inspect" on the loaded extention
block to view console messages, etc.


## Things I Learned
- There's a standard for adding in-line documentation for JavaScript, called
[JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/)
- [Scripting Web API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/scripting#runtime-functions)
