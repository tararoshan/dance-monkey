# Dance Monkey
a chrome/firefox extension to help with learning dances from YouTube videos. The
name comes from "code monkey" but for dancing (just follow what the dancer on
the screen does, code what your boss tells you to code).

## Manual Testing in Firefox
Clone the repository, open Firefox > Add-ons Manager > Extensions >
gear/settings button > **Debug Add-ons** > Load Temporary Add-on... > select the
manifest.json file of Dance Monkey. Click "Inspect" on the loaded extention
block to view console messages, etc.
